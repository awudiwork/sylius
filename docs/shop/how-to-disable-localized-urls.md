# How to disable localized URLs?

By default, Sylius uses localised URLs, meaning that they contain the `/locale` prefix to specify the current locale. For example, when the "English (United States)" locale is selected in the channel, the homepage URL might look like this: `{hostname}/en_US/`.

If you prefer to use URLs without the locale prefix, you can disable this feature by following these steps.

***

## 1. Update the Routing Configuration

To stop Sylius from generating localised URLs, you need to customize the application routing in `config/routes/sylius_shop.yaml`.

#### üîç What to Change

Use this diff to identify what should be removed or updated in `config/routes/sylius_shop.yaml`:

<pre class="language-diff"><code class="lang-diff"># config/routes/sylius_shop.yaml
    
    sylius_shop:
<strong>        resource: "@SyliusShopBundle/Resources/config/routing.yml"
</strong><strong>-       prefix: /{_locale}
</strong>-       requirements:
-          _locale: ^[A-Za-z]{2,4}(_([A-Za-z]{4}|[0-9]{3}))?(_([A-Za-z]{2}|[0-9]{3}))?$
    
    sylius_shop_payum:
        resource: "@SyliusPayumBundle/Resources/config/routing/integrations/sylius_shop.yaml"
    
-    sylius_shop_default_locale:
-        path: /
-        methods: [GET]
-        defaults:
-            _controller: sylius.controller.shop.locale_switch:switchAction
</code></pre>

#### ‚úÖ Final Configuration (After Applying the Diff)

After the changes, your `sylius_shop.yaml` file should look like this:

```yaml
# config/routes/sylius_shop.yaml

sylius_shop:
    resource: "@SyliusShopBundle/Resources/config/routing.yml"

sylius_shop_payum:
    resource: "@SyliusPayumBundle/Resources/config/routing/integrations/sylius_shop.yaml"
```

By making this change, the locale will no longer be included in the URLs generated by Sylius.

***

## 2. Use Storage-Based Locale Switching

Configure the `locale_switcher`:

```yaml
# config/packages/_sylius.yaml

sylius_shop:
    locale_switcher: storage
```

This ensures that locale selection persists across user sessions without being part of the URL.

***

## 3. Adjust the Shop URL Regex for Security

Sylius uses the `sylius.security.shop_regex` parameter to define which paths are part of the shop firewall. Without the locale prefix, you need to adapt this regex.

#### üõ°Ô∏è Add to `config/packages/security.yaml`

At the top of the file, insert:

```yaml
# config/packages/security.yaml

parameters:
    sylius.security.shop_regex: "^(?:/(?!%sylius_admin.path_name%|api/.*|api$|media/.*)[^/]++)?"
```

This update ensures the shop routes are matched correctly without the locale prefix.

## ‚úÖ Final Result

| Before (Localized URL)                                                                                    | After (Clean URL)                                                                                         |

By completing these steps:

* URLs like `/en_US/product/foo` become `/product/foo`.
* Locale persistence is handled in session or cookies, not in the URL.
* Routing and security rules continue to work correctly.

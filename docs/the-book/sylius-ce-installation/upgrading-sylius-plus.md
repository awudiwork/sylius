# Upgrading Sylius Plus

Sylius regularly releases new versions of Sylius Plus modules. Each release comes with an `UPGRADE.md` file, which is meant to help in the upgrading process.

1. Update the version constraint of your Sylius Plus modules by modifying the `composer.json` file:

```
{
    "require": {
        "sylius/plus-marketplace-suite-plugin": "^2.6"
    }
}
```

2. Upgrade dependencies by running a Composer command:

```bash
composer update sylius/plus-marketplace-suite-plugin --with-all-dependencies
```

If this does not help, it is a matter of debugging the conflicting versions and working out how your `composer.json` should look after the upgrade. You can check what version is installed by running `composer show sylius/plus-marketplace-suite-plugin` command.

3. Follow the instructions found in the `UPGRADE.md` file for a given minor release.

As Sylius Plus modules are private repositories their UPGRADE files (and CHANGELOGs) have been exposed in a separate public repository which can be found here: [https://github.com/Sylius/PlusInformationCenter](https://github.com/Sylius/PlusInformationCenter)

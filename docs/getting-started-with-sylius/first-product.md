# First Product

Products Management is one of the most important sections of the Sylius Admin panel. The **Catalog** section in the menu offers a wide range of options, but for now, we’ll focus on **product creation**.

## Simple & Configurable Products

When creating a product, you first need to choose between two types:

* **Simple Product**: A product with just one version (e.g., a standard book).
* **Configurable Product**: A product that offers options for customers to choose from (e.g., size, color, etc.).

Check out the Products chapter in the Sylius Book for more detailed information.

During the product creation process, you can define many important attributes:

* **Price**: How much does the product cost?
* **Shipping**: Is it a physical product that requires shipping?
* **Inventory Tracking**: Should the product be tracked within the inventory system?
* **Channels**: On which channels will the product be available for purchase?
* **Taxes**: Should any taxes be applied during checkout?

Take some time to explore these options in detail later. For now, let’s focus on filling in the essential data required to create a product.

## Summary

Great, the first stage is done!&#x20;

Now that the basic setup is done, we can move on to more advanced topics, such as **customizing Sylius features** and **deploying your store** to a server to make it available to the world.

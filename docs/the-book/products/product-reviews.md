# Product Reviews

Product Reviews are a marketing tool that lets your customers give opinions about the products they buy in your shop. They have a `rating` and `comment`.

### Rating

The rating of a product review is required and must be between 1 and 5.

### Product review state machine

When you look inside the `CoreBundle/Resources/config/app/state_machine/sylius_product_review.yml` you will find out that a Review can have 3 different states:

* `new`,
* `accepted`,
* `rejected`

There are only two possible transitions: `accept` (from `new` to `accepted`) and `reject` (from `new` to `rejected`).

When a review is accepted **the average rating of a product is updated**.

### How is the average rating calculated?

The average rating is updated by the [AverageRatingUpdater](https://github.com/Sylius/Sylius/blob/master/src/Sylius/Bundle/ReviewBundle/Updater/AverageRatingUpdater.php) service.

It wraps the [AverageRatingCalculator](https://github.com/Sylius/Sylius/blob/master/src/Sylius/Component/Review/Calculator/AverageRatingCalculator.php) and uses it inside the `updateFromReview` method.

### How to add a ProductReview programmatically?

Create a new review using a factory:

```php
/** @var ReviewInterface $review */
$review = $this->container->get('sylius.factory.product_review')->createNew();
```

Fill in the content of your review.

```php
$review->setTitle('My Review');
$review->setRating(5);
$review->setComment('This product is really great');
```

Then get a customer from the repository, which you would like to make an author of this review.

```php
$customer = $this->container->get('sylius.repository.customer')->findOneBy(['email' => 'john.doe@test.com']);

$review->setAuthor($customer);
```

Remember to set the object that is the subject of your review and then add the review to the repository.

```php
$review->setReviewSubject($product);

$this->container->get('sylius.repository.product_review')->add($review);
```

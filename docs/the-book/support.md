# Support

Besides our documentation, we’re proud to have a friendly and active community ready to support anyone working with Sylius.

We offer two main channels for communication and support:

## Slack – Real-Time Help from the Community

Slack is our primary platform for live community discussions. We chose Slack because many developers already use it for work, making it convenient to join the conversation without adding another tool.

**Use Slack for:**

* Quick help with urgent questions
* Discussions about Sylius development
* Contributing to the documentation
* Sharing ideas or just chatting with others

**Key channels for newcomers:**

* `#announcements` – official updates and news from the Sylius Team
* `#support` – for asking questions and helping others
* `#general` – for general Sylius development discussions
* `#random` – for off-topic chat and community banter

There are many more topic-specific channels as well. If you have suggestions on how to improve the Slack channel structure, we’d love to hear them. Drop a message on Slack!

**How to join:**\
Go to [sylius.com/slack](https://sylius.com/slack), enter your email, and you’ll receive an automatic invite.

_Use your GitHub username as your Slack display name—it helps the community recognize you more easily!_

## Stack Overflow – For Searchable, Specific Questions

We also encourage users to post Sylius-related questions on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com).

**Tips for posting:**

* **Search first** – your question might already have an answer.
* **Be specific** – Stack Overflow works best with concrete, detailed questions.
* **Use the right tags** – include the `sylius` tag, and consider adding `symfony` as well.

This helps your question reach the right audience and improves the visibility of Sylius topics for others.

## SLA-Backed Support

For teams running Sylius in production and requiring guaranteed response times, **Sylius Plus** includes access to commercial support under an SLA. This provides direct contact with the Sylius Team and ensures more predictable support for critical issues.

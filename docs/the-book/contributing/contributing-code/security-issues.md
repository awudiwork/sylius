# ⚠️ Security Issues

If you think that you have found a security issue in Sylius, **don’t use the bug tracker, and do not post it publicly**. Instead, all security issues must be sent to <mark style="color:orange;">**security@sylius.com**</mark>. Emails sent to this address are forwarded to the Sylius Development Team Members responsible for the framework’s security. Please do not reveal the issue publicly until the security fix is released and announced by Sylius.

{% hint style="warning" %}
We will not publish security releases on Saturday or Sunday, except for the vulnerabilities made public.
{% endhint %}

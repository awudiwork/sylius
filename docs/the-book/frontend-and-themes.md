  * Integrating custom JavaScript functionalities using Stimulus controllers.
  * Replacing or extending default behaviors to meet specific requirements.

## Frontend Tech Stack Overview

In Sylius 2.0, the frontend is built upon the following technologies:

* **Templating Engine:** Utilizes **Twig**, Symfony's default templating engine, for rendering views.
* **CSS Framework:** Adopts **Bootstrap 5** for styling both the Shop and Admin interfaces, replacing the previous Semantic UI framework.
* **JavaScript:** Incorporates **Symfony UX** components, including **Stimulus** and **Twig Components**, to enhance interactivity and maintainability.
* **Asset Management:** Employs **Webpack Encore**, Symfony's wrapper for Webpack, facilitating the compilation and optimization of CSS, JavaScript, and other assets.
* **Theming System:** Supports a theming system that allows for the customization and overriding of templates, assets, and translations on a per-channel basis.

# Choosing Sylius: When and Why

Sylius is not a one-size-fits-all eCommerce solution. It’s a **developer-first framework** built to serve projects where **flexibility, scalability**, and **business-specific customization** are essential.

You should consider using Sylius if these are your project needs:

#### 🎯 **Designed for Professionals**

Sylius is ideal for **agencies, technical teams, and experienced developers** who want complete control over how their eCommerce application is built, customized, and deployed. It’s based on Symfony, so it fits naturally into modern PHP workflows.

> If you're comfortable with Symfony or Laravel, you'll feel right at home with Sylius.

***

#### 🏢 **Mid-Market and Enterprise Fit**

Sylius shines in **complex B2C and B2B use cases** where off-the-shelf platforms like WooCommerce or Shopify can’t scale or adapt. It’s well-suited for:

* Multi-channel retail (e.g. online shop + mobile app)
* Internationalization (multi-currency, multi-locale)
* Integration with ERPs, CRMs, PIMs

> Sylius Plus is also available for advanced enterprise needs like RBAC, multi-source inventory, \
> and more.

***

#### 🎛️ **Precision and Control**

Sylius is fully modular and headless-ready. This means:

* You decide the business logic, checkout flow, tax rules, and promotions
* You can replace or override any service, entity, or view
* APIs are first-class, enabling custom frontends or integrations

> Nothing is hardcoded — everything is configurable or extensible.

***

#### 🧵 **Tailored Solution**

You don’t adapt your business to the platform. With Sylius, you **tailor the platform to your business**. Whether it's a subscription model, marketplace, or something completely unique, Sylius provides the groundwork; you build the rest.

***

#### ✨ **Unique Shopping Experiences**

Need a custom storefront? A voice-based shopping assistant? A mobile-first product configurator?

Sylius allows you to deliver **experiences that standard platforms can't offer**. With modern frontend compatibility (Vue, React, Next.js, etc.) and an API-first backend, the possibilities are wide open.

***

#### ✅ Summary

Use Sylius if:

* You want **full development control**
* You’re building a **custom or complex eCommerce app**
* You need to **scale and integrate** with other business systems
* You care about **clean code, modern architecture, and testing**

> If your eCommerce needs are unique — Sylius is built for you.
